At Trendency Research, I contributed to newsletters focused on political issues. Below are some highlights with links:
[Biden and Age](https://polticial-trendwatch.beehiiv.com/p/biden-age)\
Led ideation and text analysis of voter concerns about US presidential candidates' age; contributed to writing and analysis.
[Younger Voters and the Supreme Court](https://polticial-trendwatch.beehiiv.com/p/younger-voters-supreme-court)
Designed survey questions with the team to capture voters under 40â€™s perceptions of the US Supreme Court and analyzed responses related to the 2024 homelessness ruling (which banned sleeping public places). Played a primary role in analysis and writing.
Worked jointly with team members on analysis and content for these newsletters related to key events in Summer 2024 affecting the US presidential race:
